Users start in a ramdomly generated maze of 15 by 15 proportions.
 - However, users can only see nine squares at a time: the square that they are on and the 8 surrounding squares
 
 As players navigate through the maze in search of the EXIT, they encounter OBSTACLES (or mini games) at a certain frequency depending on the difficulty level of the maze.
  - MINI GAME 1: "leapfrog"
  - MINI GAME 2: sudoku
  - MINI GAME 3: simon says
  - MINI GAME 4: memory
  - More to be added if time allows
  
If players lose a mini game, they lose a LIFE. If they lose three lives, they die and the game is over (Mwahaha)


While navigating the maze a player is able to see:
  - His current position (indicated by yellow)
  - The path he can follow (indicated by white)
  - Thewalls of the maze (indicated by dark green)
  - How many lives he has (indicated in the TOOLBAR)
