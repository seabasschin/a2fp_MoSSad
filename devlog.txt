DEVLOG:
  
  DAY 0 (5 18 2016):
    
    in class: we started making a basic maze structure. created repo, devlog.
    at home: --
  
  DAY 1 (5 19 2016):
    
    in class: learned about processing
    at home: -- 

  DAY 8 (5 26 2016):
    
    in class: learned heaps
    at home: forked for the first time in HW46

  DAY 14 (5 31 2016):
    
    in class: wrote preliminary plan, started work on the maze as a group.
    at home: Created tile class, in which locations of maze are stored.

  DAY 15 (6 1 2016):
    
    in class: --
    at home: --
 
  DAY 16 (6 2 2016):
    
    in class: --
    at home:  --
    
  DAY 17 (6 3 2016):
    
    in class: Basic maze file was made and we worked on Tile creation
    at home: --
    
  DAY 18 (6 4 2016):
    
    in class: We disscussed how exactly the maze algorithm would work. Sebastian presented the Prim algorithm and spent the period trying to diagram how it works on KTS.
    at home: We didn't get much done due to SATs and just general TGIF.

  DAY 19 (6 5 2016):
    
    in class: No class
    at home: We started to better research and apply some of the different maze algorithms

  DAY 20 (6 6 2016):

  in class: No class
  at home: Shaik manaaged to create a simplified version of the Prim's maze generation alogrithm add added Version 3 of the maze file. More inscpection os needed however to verify the legitmacy of the maze.
